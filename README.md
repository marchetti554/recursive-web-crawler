Hello! This is what I could make within 4 hours, to be honest I'm not happy with the result, it barely works, I also have
to fix a problem with my channels and concurrency, my program never stops and I believe the cause is an unbuffered channel.

I've used channels before but just two or three times, what I did use more than once were wait groups (sync.WaitGroup),
but in this case I realized I needed some kind of queue in order to not download all pages so fast and therefore 
getting a network error. 

So, as you can see, I had to read and test a lot to build this program. Anyway, it was a really cool and funny challenge,
I learned so much about channels and web crawling. 

Thank you for the opportunity and for your time! 

Marco.
